# CODEWARS-KATA

This repository is made based on some of the codewars challenges.
Your challenge is to populate the functions and then to write tests for those functions.

You will also find a solutions folder , please open the solutions folder only if you are really stuck .

## Instructions

Fork this repository and clone down your fork.

Change into the cloned folder,run `npm install` to install the necessary libraries required for Node.js to run.

There are two folders: `/src` and `/__tests__`. Both contain JS files named numerically. Start on the first file in `/src` and find the matching file in `/test`. 

Once you've completed each function/test , run `npm test -- yourFunctionName` inside your cloned repo to check if your tests have worked.
